The soil of the area is also exceptionally fertile: cotton, grains, watermelon, melon, tobacco, vegetables, wine and tsipouro are only some of this landâ€™s agricultural products. Larissa is also the centre of the economic activity in Thessaly.",

A fortress was also built here by the Byzantines during the early years of their empire. Today, only the 15th century Turkish market survives, constructed with the remains of older structures like the ruins of the ancient theatre.",
